# Mechanization Audit: RULES.md Enforcement Instructions

**Date**: 2026-03-24
**Crumb**: AF-489
**Scope**: `orchestration/RULES.md` (all enforcement instructions mapped to mechanized gates)
**Status legend**:
- `MECHANIZED` — a hook, CLI tool, or checkpoint fully enforces this rule without relying on the Orchestrator's prompt text
- `PARTIALLY_MECHANIZED` — enforcement exists in code but does not cover all cases, or relies on a parameter the Orchestrator must supply correctly
- `PROMPT_ONLY` — no code enforcement; the rule exists only as prose in RULES.md or a checkpoint template

**Action legend**:
- `KEPT` — keep the RULES.md instruction as-is (defense-in-depth or prompt-only coverage)
- `SIMPLIFIED` — reduce or restructure the prose because the mechanic covers the core enforcement
- `REMOVED` — delete the instruction because the mechanic fully covers it and the prose adds confusion or redundancy

## P0 Gates

### P0-1: Startup-Check Gate (Gate Enforcement — Predecessor Gate)

**RULES.md lines**: L170–186 (Step 1b description), L332–342 (Hard Gates table)
**Mechanization**: `MECHANIZED`
**Action**: `SIMPLIFIED`

**What the rule says**: The startup-check must PASS before the Prompt Composer (and all downstream steps) can be spawned. On FAIL, re-run Recon Planner with specific violations. One retry max.

**What is mechanized**: `ant-farm-gate-enforcer.js` (PreToolUse hook on `Task`) reads `gate-status.json` from the session directory and blocks any Task spawn if the `startup-check` gate has not recorded a PASS verdict. The gate is fully enforced at the system level — the Orchestrator cannot bypass it without setting `bypass_gates: true` in config.json.

**Residual prompt value**: The RULES.md description of retry behavior (max 1 retry → escalate to user) is NOT covered by the hook; the hook only blocks or allows. The retry logic and escalation path remain as Orchestrator instructions. This portion is PROMPT_ONLY and must be KEPT.

**Recommended simplification**: Keep one sentence stating "startup-check is mechanically enforced by the gate-enforcer hook." Trim the retry count and escalation instructions to a single bullet — they remain valid Orchestrator guidance but don't need to restate what the hook does.

**Defense-in-depth consideration**: Both layers are intentional. The hook blocks at the runtime level (catches cases where the Orchestrator ignores the prose); the prose tells the Orchestrator how to respond when the hook fires. KEPT for prose, SIMPLIFIED for the hook-description portion.

---

### P0-2: Pre-Spawn-Check Gate (Prompt Audit)

**RULES.md lines**: L192–207 (Step 2 description), L332–342 (Hard Gates table)
**Template**: `orchestration/templates/checkpoints/pre-spawn-check.md`
**Mechanization**: `MECHANIZED`
**Action**: `SIMPLIFIED`

**What the rule says**: After composing agent prompts, run pre-spawn-check (Checkpoint Auditor, haiku) before spawning. Only after all pre-spawn-check PASS: spawn agents.

**What is mechanized**:
1. `ant-farm-gate-enforcer.js` records the `pre-spawn-check` gate state in `gate-status.json`. Agent spawns are blocked if `pre-spawn-check` has not passed.
2. `pre-spawn-check.md` defines 7 specific audit checks (real task IDs, real file paths, root cause text, all 7 mandatory steps present, scope boundaries, commit instructions, line specificity). The WARN/FAIL verdict thresholds are explicit and unambiguous.

**Residual prompt value**: The Orchestrator must actively spawn the Checkpoint Auditor with the correct file paths — the hook can only block, not spawn. The spawn instruction is PROMPT_ONLY and must be KEPT.

**Recommended simplification**: The RULES.md prose can drop the checklist of what pre-spawn-check verifies (it lives in the template). Keep the spawn instruction and the gate block reference.

---

### P0-3: Scope-Verify Gate (Post-Commit Scope Check)

**RULES.md lines**: L209–229 (Step 3 detail), L332–342 (Hard Gates table)
**Template**: `orchestration/templates/checkpoints/scope-verify.md`
**Mechanization**: `MECHANIZED`
**Action**: `SIMPLIFIED`

**What the rule says**: After each agent (serial mode) or all agents (batch mode) commit, run scope-verify before claims-vs-code. FAIL blocks queue progression.

**What is mechanized**:
1. `ant-farm-gate-enforcer.js` checks `scope-verify` gate status before allowing claims-vs-code spawns.
2. `scope-verify.md` defines PASS/WARN/FAIL verdict thresholds with explicit blocking behavior per verdict.
3. The mode selection rule (serial vs. batch) is mechanically derived from whether agents were spawned in a single message — a factual question, not a judgment call.

**Residual prompt value**: The Orchestrator must know the mode (serial/batch) and spawn the Checkpoint Auditor accordingly. The N=1 boundary condition and partial-wave-commit edge cases are Orchestrator instructions with no mechanic. KEPT.

**Recommended simplification**: Collapse the serial/batch prose to a brief rule and pointer to scope-verify.md. Remove the repetition of PASS/FAIL/WARN behaviors (they live in the template).

---

### P0-4: Gate Enforcement (General Hard Gates Table)

**RULES.md lines**: L330–342 (Hard Gates table)
**Mechanization**: `MECHANIZED`
**Action**: `SIMPLIFIED`

**What the rule says**: Lists all gates, what they block, and the artifact each gate produces.

**What is mechanized**: `ant-farm-gate-enforcer.js` enforces the gate chain defined in `gate-manager.js` (GATE_CHAIN constant: startup-check → pre-spawn-check → scope-verify → claims-vs-code → review-integrity → session-complete). The code reflects the same ordering as the table.

**Residual prompt value**: The table serves as a human-readable quick reference and documents artifact paths — valuable for the Orchestrator when diagnosing failures. KEPT as a reference, but the blocking semantics themselves are mechanized.

**Recommended simplification**: Add a note to the table: "Gate ordering is enforced by ant-farm-gate-enforcer.js." No prose changes needed in the table rows.

---

### P0-5: Position Check (Spawn Matches Expected Next Step)

**RULES.md lines**: L109–155 (Position Check section, global rule)
**Mechanization**: `MECHANIZED`
**Action**: `SIMPLIFIED`

**What the rule says**: Before every major phase transition, read `progress.log` to verify the next action matches the expected `next_step=` value. Mismatch → STOP.

**What is mechanized**: `ant-farm-gate-enforcer.js` calls `getExpectedNextStep(sessionDir)` from `progress-reader.js` on every Task spawn. If the spawn's prompt text does not include the expected step label, the hook blocks the spawn and writes a `position-check FAIL` verdict to `gate-status.json`. The known-steps list is hardcoded in the hook.

**Residual prompt value**: The `next_step` value convention table (L135–155) lists all valid values — this is reference material the Orchestrator uses when writing progress log entries. The hook reads these values but does not define them. The table must be KEPT.

**Recommended simplification**: Add a note to the Position Check section: "The position check is also enforced mechanically by ant-farm-gate-enforcer.js — mismatch blocks the spawn." Trim the manual-check prose ("run this command before every phase transition") to acknowledge the hook handles it.

---

### P0-6: Retry Tracking

**RULES.md lines**: L443–461 (Retry Limits table), L363–365 (Wave Management)
**Mechanization**: `MECHANIZED`
**Action**: `SIMPLIFIED`

**What the rule says**: Per-type retry limits (claims-vs-code: 2, review-integrity: 1, stuck: 0, startup-check fail: 1, Recon Planner: 1, etc.) with a global cap of 5. Track in Orchestrator's state file.

**What is mechanized**: `retry-tracker.js` implements per-type limits (`checkpoint: 2`, `agent_error: 1`, `stuck: 0`) and a global session cap of 5 in `retries.json`. `ant-farm-gate-enforcer.js` calls `canRetry()` before every Task spawn — re-spawns are blocked when limits are exhausted.

**Gap**: The hook's `RETRY_FAILURE_TYPE` is `'checkpoint'` (applies to gate-enforced re-spawns). Some RULES.md retry limits are for specific situations (startup-check FAIL → re-Recon Planner: 1) that do not map to the generic checkpoint type. These remain PROMPT_ONLY Orchestrator instructions.

**Residual prompt value**: The full Retry Limits table with human-readable scenarios (what to do, escalation paths) is PROMPT_ONLY for those cases not covered by the hook. The mechanic covers the structural cap; the table covers escalation behavior. KEPT.

**Recommended simplification**: Add a footnote to the table: "Global retry cap and per-type limits are enforced by retry-tracker.js. Retries blocked by the hook show a 'Retry limit exceeded' reason in the PreToolUse response." Trim the instruction to "Track retry count in Orchestrator state file" since retries.json handles this mechanically.

---

### P0-7: Cycle Detection in Dependency Graph

**RULES.md lines**: L332–342 (startup-check gate blocks downstream; cycle detection is in startup-check.md Check 3 implicitly via `crumb conflict-matrix`)
**Mechanization**: `MECHANIZED` (crumb.py `_detect_cycles`, `crumb doctor`)
**Action**: `KEPT`

**What the rule says**: Implicitly — via startup-check, the Recon Planner strategy must be free of intra-wave dependency violations (Check 3 in startup-check.md).

**What is mechanized**: `crumb.py` implements `_detect_cycles()` using `graphlib.TopologicalSorter`. `crumb doctor` runs cycle detection on the full task graph and breaks cycles with `_break_cycle_edges()`. The startup-check Checkpoint Auditor is directed to run `crumb conflict-matrix` as a cross-reference.

**Residual prompt value**: RULES.md does not describe cycle detection explicitly — this is covered in startup-check.md and crumb.py. The gate entry in the Hard Gates table adequately covers this. No RULES.md prose needs to be added or removed.

---

### P0-8: Banned Phrases in Acceptance Criteria

**RULES.md lines**: (Not in RULES.md directly; enforced via `crumb validate-spec`)
**Mechanization**: `PARTIALLY_MECHANIZED`
**Action**: `KEPT`

**What the rule says**: Acceptance criteria should not contain vague phrases like "works correctly" or "as expected." `crumb validate-spec <spec-file>` scans AC lines for banned phrases configured in `.crumbs/config.json`.

**What is mechanized**: `crumb.py validate-spec` (cmd_validate_spec) reads `banned_phrases` from config (defaults: "works correctly", "as expected"), compiles word-boundary regexes, and scans lines matching `AC-\d+\.\d+:`. Outputs PASS/FAIL with line-by-line matches.

**Gap**: No hook or gate triggers validate-spec automatically. It is available as a Recon Planner or Prompt Composer call but has no mandatory invocation point in RULES.md or startup-check.

**Why KEPT**: The mechanism exists and should be wired in. RULES.md does not currently instruct the Orchestrator to invoke validate-spec. This is both an audit finding and a justification for retaining a placeholder in the workflow until a follow-up crumb wires it in.

---

## P1 Gates

### P1-1: TDD Ordering (Tests Before Implementation)

**RULES.md lines**: (Implementation details in `implementation.md` Step 2.5; not in RULES.md directly)
**Mechanization**: `PARTIALLY_MECHANIZED`
**Action**: `KEPT`

**What the rule says**: Implementers must write failing tests before implementation code. `crumb validate-tdd <commit-hash>` verifies ordering. If `tdd: false`, skip check.

**What is mechanized**: `crumb.py validate-tdd` (cmd_validate_tdd) inspects a commit range, classifies files into `test_files` and `impl_files`, and identifies `ordering_violations`. The `tdd: false` flag is stored per-crumb. `claims-vs-code.md` Check 5 instructs the Checkpoint Auditor to run this command.

**Gap**: The check runs post-hoc (after commit) in claims-vs-code, not pre-emptively. No hook prevents an agent from writing implementation before tests. Enforcement is detective, not preventive.

**Why KEPT**: The post-hoc check in claims-vs-code is the correct enforcement point — the crumb track record and ordering_violations output give an unambiguous PASS/FAIL. Defense-in-depth: `implementation.md` also instructs agents directly. Both layers address different failure modes (agent defiance vs. process drift).

---

### P1-2: Security Scanner (Dangerous Patterns)

**RULES.md lines**: (No direct RULES.md instruction; security scanning is a hook)
**Mechanization**: `MECHANIZED`
**Action**: `KEPT`

**What is mechanized**: `ant-farm-security-scanner.js` (PreToolUse hook on Write, Edit, Bash) scans content for dangerous patterns from `security-scanner.js`. Enforcing mode blocks (`continue: false`); advisory mode warns. Exceptions via `security_exceptions` in `.ant-farm-scope.json`.

**RULES.md coverage**: RULES.md does not instruct the Orchestrator to run security checks explicitly — the hook operates transparently. No RULES.md change needed.

**Why KEPT**: The hook is the enforcement mechanism. No prose to add or remove from RULES.md.

---

### P1-3: Context Monitor (Warn at 35%/25% Remaining)

**RULES.md lines**: L503–510 (Context Preservation Targets)
**Mechanization**: `MECHANIZED`
**Action**: `SIMPLIFIED`

**What the rule says**: Finish with >50% context remaining; context monitor hook will warn at 35% and 25%.

**What is mechanized**: `ant-farm-context-monitor.js` (PostToolUse hook) fires at configurable thresholds (default 35%/25%) with WARNING/CRITICAL advisories injected into the model's context. Debounce prevents spam (5-tool-use window). At CRITICAL, the advisory explicitly instructs the Orchestrator to tell the user to run `/ant-farm-pause`.

**Residual prompt value**: The prose target (">50% remaining") gives the Orchestrator a planning goal — the hook only warns when already below threshold. The aspiration is PROMPT_ONLY. KEPT.

**Recommended simplification**: The sentence "The context monitor hook will warn you at 35% and 25% remaining" can be trimmed to a parenthetical — the hook fires regardless of what RULES.md says.

---

### P1-4: Pause Instruction (Inform User at Critical Context)

**RULES.md lines**: L503–510 (Context Preservation Targets; implied)
**Mechanization**: `MECHANIZED`
**Action**: `SIMPLIFIED`

**What is mechanized**: The CRITICAL advisory from `ant-farm-context-monitor.js` explicitly states: "Inform the user they should run /ant-farm-pause to preserve progress and start a new session." No separate RULES.md instruction is needed.

**Residual prompt value**: RULES.md currently only mentions the thresholds, not the pause action. The hook handles the pause instruction. No RULES.md change needed beyond noting the mechanic.

---

### P1-5: JSON Output for Agents (Machine-Readable Verdicts)

**RULES.md lines**: (Defined in checkpoint templates, not RULES.md directly)
**Mechanization**: `PROMPT_ONLY`
**Action**: `KEPT`

**What the rule says**: Checkpoint Auditor verdicts must follow a structured format (PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL with evidence). Report paths are specified per checkpoint.

**What is mechanized**: Nothing. The format is enforced only by the checkpoint template prose. No hook validates output format.

**Why KEPT**: This is a critical convention. Lack of mechanization means it's entirely reliant on the Checkpoint Auditor following its template. Defense-in-depth: the ESV and review-integrity gates verify downstream artifacts.

---

## P2 Gates

### P2-1: Conflict Matrix (File Overlap Between Waves)

**RULES.md lines**: L353–360 (Concurrency Rules: "No two agents edit the same file")
**Mechanization**: `PARTIALLY_MECHANIZED`
**Action**: `KEPT`

**What the rule says**: No two agents edit the same file — queue conflicting tasks sequentially.

**What is mechanized**:
1. `crumb.py conflict-matrix` (cmd_conflict_matrix) identifies overlapping files between open/in-progress crumbs and outputs risk tiers and wave grouping suggestions.
2. `startup-check.md` Check 1 directs the Checkpoint Auditor to verify no unresolved file overlaps exist within a wave.

**Gap**: The mechanic identifies conflicts in the briefing phase but cannot prevent the Orchestrator from spawning conflicting agents anyway — the gate blocks on overall startup-check FAIL, not specifically on conflict type. Scope-verify catches actual scope creep after the fact.

**Why KEPT**: The two-layer approach (pre-flight conflict-matrix + post-commit scope-verify) is intentional defense-in-depth. The RULES.md concurrency rule provides the conceptual frame; the tooling provides the check.

---

### P2-2: Wave Failure Threshold (>50% Failure Blocks Next Wave)

**RULES.md lines**: L475–489 (Wave Failure Threshold section)
**Mechanization**: `MECHANIZED`
**Action**: `SIMPLIFIED`

**What the rule says**: If >50% of agents in a single wave fail (after retries), stop new spawns, collect failure summaries, notify the user, and await instruction.

**What is mechanized**: `ant-farm-gate-enforcer.js` extracts the wave number from the spawn prompt and calls `getWaveStatus(sessionDir, prevWave)` from `wave-tracker.js`. If `prevWaveStatus.failureRate > waveFailureThreshold` (default 0.5), the spawn is blocked with "Wave failure threshold exceeded" reason. Threshold configurable via `config.json`.

**Residual prompt value**: The mechanic blocks the spawn; the prose defines what the Orchestrator should do (collect summaries, notify user, await instruction). The response workflow is PROMPT_ONLY. KEPT.

**Recommended simplification**: Add a note: "Wave failure threshold blocking is mechanically enforced by ant-farm-gate-enforcer.js." The four-step response procedure (stop, collect, notify, await) remains as Orchestrator guidance.

---

### P2-3: Stuck-Agent Detection (No Commit Within 15 Turns)

**RULES.md lines**: L463–473 (Stuck-Agent Diagnostic Procedure)
**Mechanization**: `PARTIALLY_MECHANIZED`
**Action**: `SIMPLIFIED`

**What the rule says**: When an agent has no commit within 15 turns, follow a diagnostic procedure before escalating.

**What is mechanized**: `ant-farm-gate-enforcer.js` implements `checkStuckAgents()` which reads agent spawn timestamps from `agents.json` and emits WARNING (≥10 min, configurable) and CRITICAL (≥15 min, configurable) advisories. The advisory is injected into the Orchestrator's context via the PreToolUse response.

**Gap**: The mechanic uses wall-clock time (minutes since spawn), not turn count (15 turns). "15 turns" in RULES.md is a proxy for elapsed time that the hook implements as minutes. The semantic match is approximate, not exact.

**Residual prompt value**: The 5-step diagnostic procedure (read task brief, check partial summaries, check git log, check last output, escalate) is PROMPT_ONLY — the hook flags but does not diagnose. KEPT.

**Recommended simplification**: Update RULES.md to reference wall-clock time (matching the hook's actual implementation): "When an agent has been active for >10 minutes without a commit, the context monitor raises a WARNING advisory; at >15 minutes it escalates to CRITICAL." Remove the "15 turns" framing.

---

### P2-4: Spec Coverage (`validate-coverage`)

**RULES.md lines**: (Not explicitly in RULES.md — in crumb CLI help and orchestration tooling)
**Mechanization**: `PARTIALLY_MECHANIZED`
**Action**: `KEPT`

**What is mechanized**: `crumb.py validate-coverage` (cmd_validate_coverage) scans open crumbs for requirement (REQ) references and checks coverage against a spec file. This is available as a Recon Planner or Checkpoint Auditor tool call.

**Gap**: RULES.md does not instruct the Orchestrator to run validate-coverage at any specific step. The tool exists but has no defined trigger point in the main workflow.

**Why KEPT**: The tool is available but its use is discretionary. This is an audit finding: the mechanic is built but not wired into the workflow gates. Recommend a follow-up crumb to add a `validate-coverage` call to startup-check or Step 1b.

---

## Additional Enforcement Instructions (Prompt-Only)

### Additional-1: Orchestrator Read Restrictions (FORBIDDEN File List)

**RULES.md lines**: L56–65
**Mechanization**: `PROMPT_ONLY`
**Action**: `KEPT`

**What the rule says**: The Orchestrator must never read certain files (agent instruction files, checkpoint definitions, source code). These are delegated to subagents.

**Why PROMPT_ONLY**: No hook enforces Orchestrator read restrictions. The Orchestrator's tool calls are not filtered by file type.

**Why KEPT**: Essential for preventing context bloat and maintaining the information hierarchy. The Orchestrator's compliance is the only enforcement mechanism. Critical to retain.

---

### Additional-2: Orchestrator Prohibition (No Direct Crumb Commands)

**RULES.md lines**: L23–33
**Mechanization**: `PROMPT_ONLY`
**Action**: `KEPT`

**What the rule says**: The Orchestrator must not run `crumb show`, `crumb ready`, `crumb list`, `crumb blocked` — these go through the Recon Planner.

**Why PROMPT_ONLY**: No hook prevents the Orchestrator from calling crumb CLI commands or MCP tools directly. The prohibition exists only as a CLAUDE.md/RULES.md instruction.

**Historical note**: This prohibition was moved from RULES.md mid-turn content to CLAUDE.md (system prompt) to prevent parallel dispatch races (see MEMORY.md). RULES.md retains the instruction for completeness but CLAUDE.md is the authoritative enforcement point.

**Why KEPT**: Defense-in-depth. The CLAUDE.md system prompt is the primary gate; RULES.md is secondary. Both are PROMPT_ONLY but operate at different precedence levels.

---

### Additional-3: Wave Pipelining (Wave N+1 Prompt Composer Concurrent)

**RULES.md lines**: L198–206 (Step 2 wave pipelining)
**Mechanization**: `PROMPT_ONLY`
**Action**: `KEPT`

**What the rule says**: When spawning wave N Implementers, include the wave N+1 Prompt Composer in the SAME message so they launch concurrently.

**Why PROMPT_ONLY**: No hook enforces message batching. The Orchestrator can spawn agents one message at a time without consequence from the gate system.

**Why KEPT**: Performance optimization with no mechanical enforcement. The benefit (20-30% session time reduction) is real and worth retaining in RULES.md as Orchestrator guidance.

---

### Additional-4: Agent Task Cap (≤3 Tasks Per Agent Per Wave)

**RULES.md lines**: L355–356 (Concurrency Rules)
**Mechanization**: `PARTIALLY_MECHANIZED`
**Action**: `KEPT`

**What is mechanized**: `startup-check.md` Check 1b directs the Checkpoint Auditor to verify no agent has more than 3 tasks per wave. startup-check FAIL blocks downstream work.

**Gap**: The check runs pre-flight (before spawning) but does not prevent mid-session task rebalancing that could push an agent over the cap. The gate covers the briefing-time assignment, not runtime additions.

**Why KEPT**: The pre-flight check catches the common case. The prose in RULES.md provides the rationale (scope creep, context bloat, quality), which complements the mechanical count check.

---

## Instructions That Should Be KEPT as Defense-in-Depth

The following instructions are mechanized but should remain in RULES.md because the mechanical layer and the prose layer address different failure modes:

| Instruction | Why Defense-in-Depth |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Startup-check gate prose | Hook blocks; prose defines retry and escalation behavior the hook cannot supply |
| Pre-spawn-check gate prose | Hook blocks; prose tells Orchestrator when and how to spawn the Checkpoint Auditor |
| Scope-verify gate prose | Hook records; prose defines serial vs. batch mode selection and edge cases |
| Claims-vs-code gate prose | Hook records; prose defines resume-agent workflow and retry escalation |
| Position check next_step table | Hook enforces the check; table defines valid values the Orchestrator must write |
| Retry limits table | Hook enforces counts; table defines per-scenario escalation behavior |
| Context monitor thresholds | Hook fires the warning; prose sets the planning target (>50% remaining) |
| Wave failure threshold | Hook blocks spawn; prose defines Orchestrator response (collect summaries, notify, await) |
| Conflict matrix rule | crumb conflict-matrix identifies; startup-check gates on it; prose provides the design intent |
| Orchestrator prohibitions | No hook enforces; CLAUDE.md is primary; RULES.md is secondary defense |
| Scope enforcement | scope-advisor hook fires advisory/block; implementation.md scope boundary section provides agent-facing instruction |

---

## Adjacent Issues (Do Not Fix Here)

1. **validate-coverage has no defined trigger**: `crumb validate-coverage` exists but RULES.md does not specify when the Orchestrator or Recon Planner should invoke it. Recommend adding to startup-check or Recon Planner workflow.

2. **"15 turns" vs. wall-clock time mismatch**: RULES.md says "no commit within 15 turns" but the hook uses minutes. The units are inconsistent. A follow-up crumb should align the prose to "15 minutes" or parameterize the hook to support turn counting.

3. **review-integrity gate is in the Hard Gates table but not in the main step narrative**: Step 3b delegates to RULES-review.md but the Hard Gates table references review-integrity. A reader of RULES.md alone cannot locate where this gate is invoked.

4. **session-complete gate**: Fully mechanized but the escalation paths (on second FAIL, present to user) are PROMPT_ONLY. These should remain in RULES.md.
