# Changelog

## 2026-02-17 — Session 6ecb64 (Review Cycle)

### Review Summary

Code review of 6 tasks across 4 epics (d6k, 21d, 753, amk) from session 795d29.

- 72 raw findings from 4 Nitpicker reviewers (clarity, edge-cases, correctness, excellence)
- 40 root causes after Big Head deduplication (44% dedup rate)
- 1 P1, 6 P2, 33 P3

### Deferred P1

- **ant-farm-0mx**: PII scrub regression — `bd sync` (commit f455361) reverted the email scrub from task i0c (commit 047f1be). All records in `.beads/issues.jsonl` still contain owner email at HEAD. User decision: defer fix, document here.
